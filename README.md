MyGNotifier
===========

A simple Gmail Imap Notifier (only in Italian)
This simple application runs in the tray and programmatically scans your imap folder to check the unread messages.
When it finds any new email it shows a nice pop up, summing up its date/from/subject info.

It is only on Italian, but I already started developing the "resx" to localize it in "en-US".

Enjoy and let me know!
